A bot that watches the price of an item on amazon until it drops below a
specified price. The bot then automatically purchases the item

# BEFORE USING THIS CODE
The `__purchase` method in `pricewatch.py` will handle actual payment. I 
take no responsibility for any financial mishaps that occur as a result of
running this code.

Personally, I would recommend either checking the method or rewriting it 
from scratch before using this code.
